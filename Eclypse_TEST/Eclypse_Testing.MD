# Eclypse Z7 Testing

## PLL Output

A PLL signal was output from the PMOD on the PYNQ to test the feasability of outputing a clock over PMOD ports. The code for the PLL was based on code that was tested on the PYNQ-Z2. The guide linked below was used as a starting place for code on the PYNQ-Z2.   The output was tested with a cheap oscilliscope.

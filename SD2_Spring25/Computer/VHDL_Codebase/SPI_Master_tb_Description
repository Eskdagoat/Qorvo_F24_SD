Key Features of SPI_Master_tb.vhd

1. Clock Generation:

    Generates a 10 MHz clock signal to drive the SPI_Master module.
    Ensures timing accuracy for the simulation.

2. Reset Logic:

    Applies a reset at the beginning of the simulation to initialize the SPI_Master module.

3. Transaction Simulation:

    Simulates a 16-bit transaction for the MCP23017:
        Activates start_exp and verifies data transmission and chip-select behavior.
    Simulates a 32-bit transaction for the ADF4351:
        Activates start_lo and verifies longer data transactions and chip-select management.

4. Assertions:

    Ensures proper activation and deactivation of chip-select signals (CS_Exp and CS_LO).
    Verifies the correct behavior of busy and done signals during and after transactions.

5. Expected Results:

    Monitors MOSI and SCK signals to ensure correct data shifting and clock synchronization.
    Simulates the MISO response to test the reception functionality.

6. Simulation Completion:

    Completes the simulation after verifying both transactions and reports success or failure using assertions.

Key Features of SPI_Master.vhd

1. Clocking:

    The SPI clock (SCK) is directly derived from the 10 MHz input clock.
    SCK ensures proper synchronization of data transfers.

2. Finite State Machine (FSM):

    State 0 (Idle):
        Waits for a start_exp or start_lo signal to initiate a transaction.
        Activates the appropriate chip-select (CS_Exp or CS_LO) and loads the data to be transmitted.
    State 1 (Transmit):
        Transmits data serially via MOSI and receives data via MISO.
        Manages bit-by-bit shifting using shift_reg and rx_reg.
    State 2 (Complete):
        Finalizes the transaction by deactivating the chip-select.
        Outputs the received data (data_out) and asserts the done signal.

3. Chip-Select (CS) Management:

    Uses two separate chip-select signals:
        CS_Exp: Selects the MCP23017 for 16-bit transactions.
        CS_LO: Selects the ADF4351 for 32-bit transactions.
    Ensures only one device is active at a time.

4. Shift Registers:

    Transmission (shift_reg): Handles bit-by-bit data output on MOSI.
    Reception (rx_reg): Collects data from MISO during the transaction.

5. Dynamic Configuration:

    Automatically adjusts the number of bits to shift (16 or 32) based on the selected device.
    Supports both short (16-bit) and long (32-bit) transactions seamlessly.

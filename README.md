# **QORVO_RADIO**
### Objective
Design and Develop a modular and reconfigurable Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform to support future student projects, ensuring a flexible and adaptive environment.
### Key Functionality 
Facilitate simultaneous testing of multiple RF modules with independent digital control. __
Operate at a frequency range of 85-2500 MHz, featuring dual receive (Rx) channels.

Provide seamless interaction between hardware and software via a USB interface.


## Computer Engineering

### FPGA and Control System Integration
Flexibility: Dynamic reconfiguration support.

Connectivity: GNU Radio for user-defined control.

Precision: Stable high-quality RF performance.

Reliability: Low-latency communication.

Expansion: Modular design for hardware enhancement.


### Design Analysis
Designed a GNU Radio flow to provide both audio and visual representations of received signals.

Validated output using the Pluto SDR platform.

Successfully verified GNU based FPGA control.
